  <h2>Research profile</h2>

  <p>
    My research explores strategic communication processes in innovation-driven contexts,
    with a particular focus on startups, gender dynamics and emerging entrepreneurial ecosystems.
    I am especially interested in how communication contributes to visibility, legitimacy
    and social impact in early-stage organizations and cultural and tourism institutions.
